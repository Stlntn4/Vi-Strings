Hi everyone, today I'll show you some basic violin tips to get you started.

2
00:01.640 --> 00:04.279
Let's go! First, place the violin on your left shoulder.

3
00:04.279 --> 00:10.519
Rest your chin on the chin rest.

4
00:10.519 --> 00:13.400
Your left hand should gently hold the neck.

5
00:13.400 --> 00:18.160
Your right hand will hold the bow.

6
00:18.160 --> 00:20.720
Make sure the thumb is bent and your fingers are curved.

7
00:20.720 --> 00:25.160
Relax your grip so you can play smoothly.

8
00:25.160 --> 00:28.320
Tuning is important! The strings are G, D, A, E.

9
00:28.320 --> 00:32.040
You can use a tuner or adjust the pegs until the strings sound just right.

10
00:32.040 --> 00:37.520
Let's play the open strings!

11
00:37.520 --> 00:53.240

12
00:53.240 --> 00:57.680
Use smooth, even bow strokes.

13
00:57.680 --> 01:03.199
Practice playing the strings slowly at first.

14
01:03.199 --> 01:06.320
It helps with getting a clear sound and building confidence.

15
01:06.320 --> 01:12.080
That's all for this quick tutorial!

16
01:12.080 --> 01:15.040
Keep practicing and you will improve in no time!
